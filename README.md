## What it is

Monoline is for people who keep notes in Markdown and want the site to look like the file: designers, product people, researchers, anyone with a folder of notes worth publishing. Everything structural is in a monospace face: the navigation, the paths, the dates, the titles, the headings. The reading text is in a legible sans. The home page and the index are dense tables, one note per line. The space around a note is left empty.

**The source gutter** is what it is built around. Beside every block of a note, in a narrow grey gutter, sits the Markdown that made it: `##` by a heading, `>` by a quote, `-` and `3.` instead of bullets, a fence by the code, `[^1]` by a footnote. Plain paragraphs have none, so the markers show the note's structure at a glance. You write ordinary Markdown; the markers are read from your files when the site builds. On a phone the gutter folds into a prefix on each block's first line. Turn it off with one setting.

## Features

- Astro 7 + Tailwind CSS v4, static output; the only client-side JavaScript is the theme toggle
- The source gutter for headings, quotes, lists (with their real numbers), code, rules and footnotes
- Home and index as tables of notes: date, title, tag; the index grouped by year
- A note page with its path, word count and reading time, and the older and newer notes
- An About page in the same column, with the gutter
- RSS, sitemap, structured data
- Dark mode, responsive from 360px, Lighthouse 95+ on all four categories, checked in CI
- Type-safe content collection (Markdown and MDX), and `AGENTS.md` for Claude Code / Cursor

## Quick start

You need Node.js 22.12+ and pnpm 9 or newer (`npm i -g pnpm`). `package.json` pins the exact pnpm version, and pnpm 10+ switches to it on its own.

```sh
pnpm create astro@latest my-site -- --template ondelva/astro-theme-monoline
cd my-site
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` also serves `/styleguide`: every colour token, the type, a sample note with its gutter, and the table. It is not part of a build.

## Configure

Everything site-specific lives in `src/config.ts`: your name, the URL, the line at the top of the home page, the switches. Colours are tokens you override in `src/styles/theme.css`.

- [docs/content.md](docs/content.md): writing a note, its fields, the gutter markers
- [docs/customization.md](docs/customization.md): every config group, the tokens, fonts, the footer credit
- [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md): build, hosting, CI
